# handwriting-neuralnet Summary
The point of this project was to start learning neural networks and to eventually move into deep learning and other machine learning projects. As my first neural network project, I tackled what some have called the "hello-world" of neural networks; categorizing hand-written digits using a neural network.
## Data
I will be using [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)'s dataset of handwritten digits to train my neural network.
## Architecture
TBD, write down implementation here later...
## Results
TBD...
